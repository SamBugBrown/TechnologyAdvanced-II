#TechnologyAdvanced II
TechnologyAdvanced II is our current edition of TechnologyAdvanced. TechnologyAdvanced II was a complete revamp of TechnologyAdvanced Beta, and has been the most organized edition of TechnologyAdvanced. The Primary Focus of TechnologyAdvanced II is Technology, as was in TechnologyAdvanced Beta. The "core mods" of TechnologyAdvanced II are Thermal Expansion, IndustrialCraft 2 & TechReborn, GalactiCraft, and ThaumCraft! We hope TechnologyAdvanced II will satisfy your taste for Modded Minecraft.

#TechnologyAdvanced III
As TechnologyAdvanced II is crushing bugs, refining it's mods and other things, we're prepping for TechnologyAdvanced III. Yeah, TechnologyAdvanced III. This will be the third major revamp of TechnologyAdvanced. TechnologyAdvanced III should be compatible with TechnologyAdvanced II worlds, so no need to worry about loosing your progress! TechnologyAdvanced III will hopefully be removing those pesky mods that nobody uses, to clean out for the future updates! Due to this being so far fetched into the future, we really can't say what's to come yet - but it may change your Minecraft experience forever.
